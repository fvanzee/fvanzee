I'm a software developer with 15+ years experience.
<br />
<br />
I've worked with a wide range of technologies, from PLC programming to high-level web development.
<br />
<br />
The clients I've worked with have been in a wide range of industries, from industrial and warehouse automation, to e-commerce and the sports industry.
<br />
<br />
In recent years, my focus has been on backend development for web applications, building APIs, setting up infrastructure and DevOps workflows.
<br />
This has also included working with many major cloud services, often implementing cloud native technologies like Kubernetes.
<br />
<br />
In my personal time I've been working on a couple of projects, with a special interest developing applications in Rust.
<br />
<br />
I'm someone that likes to work in close relation with clients and stakeholders.
